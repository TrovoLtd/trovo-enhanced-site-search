# trovo-enhanced-site-search
Plugin framework for website search, intended to connect multiple search providers to multiple content management systems.

The initial piece of work will be to port the core Trovo Enhanced Site Search (TESS) core application from C#, with a Google Site Search plugin.

The idea is to use the plugin framework to add search capability from other providers such as Bing, Amazon A9, Solr and Elastic Search.
