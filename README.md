# trovo-enhanced-site-search

Plugin framework for website search, intended to connect multiple search providers to multiple content management systems.

Check the Wiki for the [Theory behind this project](https://github.com/TrovoLtd/trovo-enhanced-site-search/wiki/The-one-minute-explanation-of-this-project).

The initial piece of work will be to port the core Trovo Enhanced Site Search (TESS) core application from C#, with a Google Site Search plugin.

The idea is to use the plugin framework to add search capability from other providers such as Bing, Amazon A9, Solr and Elastic Search.
